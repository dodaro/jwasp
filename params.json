{"name":"Jwasp","tagline":"","body":"jwasp\r\n====\r\nJWASP is an ASP solver for normal logic program based on the well-known SAT/Pseudo-Boolean solver SAT4J (http://www.sat4j.org/).\r\nJWASP extends SAT4J by implementing an algorithm based on **source pointers** for the unfounded sets computation.\r\n\r\nAt the moment, the grounder is still missing, thus JWASP takes as input logic programs in the GRINGO format.\r\nIn future the idea is to extend JWASP in order to take as input a non-ground ASP program.\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n===\r\nIn order to use JWASP you need the grounder GRINGO (http://potassco.sourceforge.net/).\r\n\r\nIf gringo has been downloaded just type:\r\n```\r\n./gringo filename | java -jar jwasp.jar\r\n```\r\n\r\nTests\r\n===\r\nFor tests, we used the test environment of WASP (https://github.com/alviano/wasp.git).\r\nIn order to test the solver just type:\r\n```\r\nmake test\r\n```\r\n","google":"UA-40548229-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
